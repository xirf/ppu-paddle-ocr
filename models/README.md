The `PP-OCRv5_mobile_det_infer` and `en_PP-OCRv4_mobile_rec_infer` are there for backwards compatibility.
Newer release model will be release and renamed as `paddleocr-detection` and `paddleocr-recognition` respectfully.

### Current model used

- Detection: `PP-OCRv5_mobile_det_infer`
- Recognition: `en_PP-OCRv5_mobile_rec_infer`

### Recommendation

It is best to use your target language model, the Paddle team have a great job in training model for specific language.
For example if your target is Thai language, you can go and download the thai model from paddleocr site then also the dictionary.
The default use here is using English model.
